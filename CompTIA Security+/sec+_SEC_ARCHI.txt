CLOUD-RELATED CONCEPTS:

!! Describe a cloud responsibility matrix; hybrid ocnsiderations; third-party vendors; Infrastructure as code; serverless
    microservices

- Cloud Responsibilty: Responsibility matrix is a tool used because of Shared responsibilty model that exists with respect to public cloud. Its based on the fact that a cloud customer is responsible for moany of their security concerns, while simult., a cloud provider is responsible for others.

- the most popular cloud deployment model today is the hybrid model, combo of cloud and on-presmises resources typically used by modern IT departments

- public cloud involves third-party vendors, such as contractors, but differences do exist. Ex is that w/ cloud, theres typically much shorter contract durations and resources availiable on demand without long provisioning cycles and negotitations.

- IaC (Infrastructure as code): revolutionary approach to managing and provisioning tech infrastructure in a scalable, efficient, and automated manner. It involves using machine-readable scripts or configuration files to define and deploy infrastructure resources, such as servers, networks and storage rather than relying on manual and error-prone processes.

- Serverless computing: cloud-computing paradigm that allows developers to build and run apps without the need to manage traditional server infrastructure. In a serverless architecture:

    * Developers only need to focus on writing code for individual functions or units of logic, which are executed in stateless, ephemeral onctainers in response to specific events or triggers.

    * Cloud providers automatically handle provisioning, scaling, and management of resourcesm enabling developers to focus on coding business logic without worrying about server maintenance.

- Microservers Infrastructure: modern architectural approach to building and deploying software apps. In this model:

    * A large monolithic app is a broken down int osmaller, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability or function. 

    * These services communicate with each other through lightweight APIs, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE CONCEPTS:

!! Describe network infrastructure concepts including physical isolation; logical segmentationl SDN; on-premises vs cloud; centralized vs decentralized architectures

- Network infrastructures:

    * Some networks carry such sensitive information that theyre air-gapped, which means theyre physically disconnected from public internet.

    * Logical segmentation is a much more common approach and uses software constructs to create a virtual network inside a physical network. Technologies such as virtual local area networks (VLANS) and virtual extensible lans (VXLANs) are common methods of logical segmentation

    * SDN is a revolutionary approach to network management and control that simplifies and centralizes management of network resources. It separates the control and data planes, enabling a admin to programmatically control network behavrior through a centralized software controller.

- Centralized infrastructure: features the required network elements located ina central locaiton versus being dispersed through the geography of the IT department.

    * Easier to secure since reousresc are more concentrated in a single locaiton and easier to protect with network apps/tec

VIRTUALIZATION CONCEPTS:

- Vritualization: software simulates hardware functionality to create avirtual computer system, which enables you to use one server to run multiple virtual systems 

    * Server Virtualization 
    * Network Virtualization
    * Storage Virtualization
    * Desktop virtualizaiton

        > Hypervisor software makes VMs possible and we need to be concerned about securing VM OS.

- Containers: enable operation of mutiple OS inside a single instance, consists of entire runtime environ bundled
     into 1 packages, including all application:
    
    * Dependencies
    * Libraries
    * Config files
    * Additionally binaries that are required for an application to run

        > Typically manage containers using software such as KUBERNETES. Such packages are responsible for
            scheduling and securing container deployments.

IOT AND SCADA (SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION):

- IOT Architectures: security implications: refers to pieces that comprise IoT networking systems including sensors,
    actuators, cloud services, protocols and layers. 

    * Security implication: significant, proliferation of connected devices increaes attack surface and potential vulner.

    * Ensure robust sec measures such as encryption, authentication, access controls, and regular software updates help:
        > safeguard sens data.
        > protect against unauthorized access
        > prevent malicious actors from exploiting IoT devices to compromise the overall system and user privacy.

- ICS and SCADA Architectures: Security implications: Industrial control system and SCADA architec. models are of utmose concern,
    as these systems control critical infrastructure and industrial processes. The potential consequences of sec breaches in
    these environments can be severe and include:

    * Produciton disruptions
    * physical harm
    * environmental damage

        > Critical to hae stringent sec measures, network seg, air gapping, and continuous monitoring to defend against
            cyber threats and unauthorized access for these architectures.

- RTOS architectures: security implications: Real time operating system architectural model are paramount, as these systems often
    are used in safety-critical applications and devices. Vulnerabilities or explois in an RTOS can lead to:

    * real-time performance degradation
    * loss of control
    * life-threatening consequences

        > critical that you have rigoroues sec testing, memory protection, and secure coding practices to ensure integrity
            and reliability of a RTOS system.

- Embedded system architectures: security implications: can be critical because of the constrained resources and limited processing
    capabilities of these devices. Vulnerabilities in embedded systems can lead to:
    
    * unauthorized access
    * data breaches
    * potential exploitation of connected networks

        > important to have robust sec measures, secure boot procedures, regular firmware updates to mitigate risks and
            protect against cyber threats with these systems.

    * attack surfaces
    * connectivity
    * failure models
    * active and passive devices

- Security zones: help safeguard sens informatio and crit assets.
    *categorizing different network segments, based on risk profiles and access requirements, security zones enable 
        a granual approach to defense

- Attack surfaces: influences organizations vulnerability landscape
    * encompasses all potential points of entry that malicious acators could exploit to breach a system or network.
    * reduce threat exposure by meticulous analysis

- connectivity: servers as enabler and potential vulnerabaility.
    * crucial for efficient data exchange, collab, and business ops
    * must be carefully balanced with robust sec measures
    * VPN, SSL, encrypted comm channels, ensures sens data remains encrypted and protected during transmission

- Failure modes: fail open vs fail closed configurations, holds significance in meticulous planning of cybersec infra.
    * determines how system reponsed in face of unexpected events or technical malfunctions
        > Fail closed: ensures if failure or breach occurs, system defaults to a secure state, denying access and preserving
            integrity of sensitive resources
        > Fail open: while potentially maintaining operational continuity during failures, could inadvertently expose 
            the network to vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

- Active and passive devices
        > Active devices: (ex. intrustion detection systems and firewalls) proactively monitor and actively intervene
            in network traffic to identify and mitigate threats in real-time.
            >> dynamic response capabilities are vital for swiftly neutralizing emerging threats and enforcing sec policies.
        
        > Passive devices: (ex. networking monitoring tools and audit logs) observe and collect dat awithout actively
            intervening.

NETWORK APPLIANCES:

- Jump servers: serve as intermediary access point between different security zones, typically within a secure network
    an external network, such as the internet.
    * act as gateway for admin and authorized users to access sensitive systems and resources residing in protected areas

- Proxy servers: intermediary between client devices and other servers on the internet. When a client sends a request for 
    a resource, a proxy server intercepts the request and forwards it to the destination server.
    * provides several benefits, including enhancing privacy and security and performance optimization
    * can mask identity and location of the original requester, adding a layer of anonymity.

- Intrusion prevention system (IPS) and intrustion detection system (IDS): designed to actively identify, prevent, and
    respond to unauthorized or malicious activities within a network environment.
    * constanly monitors incoming and outgoing traffic, analyzing it for patterns and signatures indicative of known 
        attacks, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavrior
    * upon detection, IPS can immediate action to block, quarantine, or alert administrators about the potential threat,
        thereby helping prevent cyber attacks, data breaches, or other sec incidents.
    * IDS can identify an attack is taking place and notify you, but doesnt take action to mitigate an attack
        like an IPS
        > many devices today ahve both IPS and IDS capabilities

- Load Balancers: vital for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources. 
    * primary obj to optimize the utilization of available resources, enhance performance, and ensure high availability    
        of apps or services.
    * helps prevent any single server from being overwhelmed by evenly distributing incoming requests.
    * helps mitigate the risk of downtime or performance bottlenecks.

- Sensors: collects or monitors various types of data and activities within the network environment.
    * acts as observant node, sensors continuously gather info about network traffic, user behavior, system performance
        and potential sec threats.
    * data then analyzed and processed to provide insights into networks overall health, usage patterns, and pot vuln.
    * enhance network management, sec and optimization by enabling realtime detection of anomolies, breaches or unus behav.

PORT SECURITY:

- What is IEEE 802.1X?: standard that defines port-based network access control.
    * w/802.1X devices attempting to connect to a network port are required to undergo an authentication process before
        being granted access.
    * involves three key components:
        > supplicant (connecting devices)
        > authenticator (the network switch or access point)
        > authentication server (verifies user credentials)
    * in 802.1X context, EAP is a framework that enables various authentication methods to be used within 802.1X framework.
    * This flexibility allows organizations to choose the most suitable authentication mechanism for their environment EAP methods:
        > usernamen and password   
        > digital certificates
        > tokens
        > more advaned methods (biometric authentication)

- device connects to network port -> sends EAP request to authenticator -> forwards it to authentication server -> 
    verifies crednetials provided by the device and informs the authenticator wheter access should be granted or denied ->
    successful authentication -> port is enabled for data comms; otherwise port remains inactive.

FIREWALL TYPES:

- Layer 4 (L4) thorugh Layer 7 (L7): applicaton or advanced firewall.
    * provide more granular and cotext-aware security measures by inspecting and controlling traffic based on application-specific
        information, user behavior, and content
        > unlike lower-layer FW that focus on source and destination addresses, these fw delve into content and cotext of data packets

- WAFs: web app fw, positioned between a web server and its users, analyzes and filters incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic,
    scrutinizing it for malicious activies, unauthorized access attempts, and app-layer vulnerabilities
    * protect web apps from cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 
    * operate by enforcing security policies based on understanding of web-application behavior and common attack patterns, such
        as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forger (CSRF).
    * actively inspecting the content, headers, and parameters of incoming requests, a WAF identifies and blocks malicious
        requuests, effectively preventing attackers from exploiting potential weaknesses in the application's code or design.

- UTM firewalls: combines multiple sec functionalities into a single platform, designed to protect networks from a diverse range
    of cyber threats. Unlike traditional firewalls that focus primarily on packet filtering and access control, UTM firewalls offer
    an integrated suite of security features including:
    * IDS, IPS
    * antivirus and atimalware
    * content filtering
    * application control
    * VPNs

- NGFW: next-gen fw, goes beyond traditional fw functions to provide defense against modern cyber threats. Unlike conventional
    fw that primarily focus on port and protocol filtering, next-gen fw off a blend of capabilities including:
    * deep packet inspection
    * intrusion prevention
    * applicaiton awareness and control
    * user identity tracking
    * integrated threat intelligence
        > features enable NGFWs to analyze the content and context of network traffic, identifying both known and unknown threats
            , and providing the ability to block malicious activities in real time. NGFWs often incorporate advanced threat-detection
                mechanisms, such as behavioral analysis and machine learning, to identify emerging threats and zero-day vulnerabilties.

SECURE COMMUNICATION AND ACCESS:

- VPN: establishing secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network such as internet, allowing users to access
    and transmite data as if they were directly connected to a private network.
    * by creating virtual tunnel between the users device and a VPN server, VPNs ensure privacy, anonymity, and data integrity,
        and they effectively shield online activies from potential eavesdropping, censorship or cyber attacks.

- TLS: cryptographic protocol ensures secure comms over computer networks, most commonly the internet.
    * functions by establishing an encrypted and authenticated connection between two parties, typically a client and a server
        thereby safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged during online interactions.
        > combo of asymmetric and symmetric encryption techniques to secure the data transmission, preventing unauthorized
            access, data tampering, and eavesdropping.

- IPSec:suite of protocols and algorithms used to secure and authenticate IP comms at network layer. 
    * offers a framework for creating encrypted and authenticated comms between devices, such as routers or VPN gateways, to ensure
        confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted over potentially untrusted networks such as internet.
