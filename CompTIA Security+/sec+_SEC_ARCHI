CLOUD-RELATED CONCEPTS:

!! Describe a cloud responsibility matrix; hybrid ocnsiderations; third-party vendors; Infrastructure as code; serverless
    microservices

- Cloud Responsibilty: Responsibility matrix is a tool used because of Shared responsibilty model that exists with respect to public cloud. Its based on the fact that a cloud customer is responsible for moany of their security concerns, while simult., a cloud provider is responsible for others.

- the most popular cloud deployment model today is the hybrid model, combo of cloud and on-presmises resources typically used by modern IT departments

- public cloud involves third-party vendors, such as contractors, but differences do exist. Ex is that w/ cloud, theres typically much shorter contract durations and resources availiable on demand without long provisioning cycles and negotitations.

- IaC (Infrastructure as code): revolutionary approach to managing and provisioning tech infrastructure in a scalable, efficient, and automated manner. It involves using machine-readable scripts or configuration files to define and deploy infrastructure resources, such as servers, networks and storage rather than relying on manual and error-prone processes.

- Serverless computing: cloud-computing paradigm that allows developers to build and run apps without the need to manage traditional server infrastructure. In a serverless architecture:

    * Developers only need to focus on writing code for individual functions or units of logic, which are executed in stateless, ephemeral onctainers in response to specific events or triggers.

    * Cloud providers automatically handle provisioning, scaling, and management of resourcesm enabling developers to focus on coding business logic without worrying about server maintenance.

- Microservers Infrastructure: modern architectural approach to building and deploying software apps. In this model:

    * A large monolithic app is a broken down int osmaller, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability or function. 

    * These services communicate with each other through lightweight APIs, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE CONCEPTS:

!! Describe network infrastructure concepts including physical isolation; logical segmentationl SDN; on-premises vs cloud; centralized vs decentralized architectures

- Network infrastructures:

    * Some networks carry such sensitive information that theyre air-gapped, which means theyre physically disconnected from public internet.

    * Logical segmentation is a much more common approach and uses software constructs to create a virtual network inside a physical network. Technologies such as virtual local area networks (VLANS) and virtual extensible lans (VXLANs) are common methods of logical segmentation

    * SDN is a revolutionary approach to network management and control that simplifies and centralizes management of network resources. It separates the control and data planes, enabling a admin to programmatically control network behavrior through a centralized software controller.

- Centralized infrastructure: features the required network elements located ina central locaiton versus being dispersed through the geography of the IT department.

    * Easier to secure since reousresc are more concentrated in a single locaiton and easier to protect with network apps/tec

VIRTUALIZATION CONCEPTS:

- Vritualization: software simulates hardware functionality to create avirtual computer system, which enables you to use one server to run multiple virtual systems
