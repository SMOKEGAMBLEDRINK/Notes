SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORIES:

BCP: Business continuity plans
IRP: Incident response plans

- Technical
- Administrative (policies, procedures, guidelines, IRP, BCP, Data classification, etc.)
- Physical
- Operational
- Managerial

EXAMINING SECURITY CONTROL TYPES:

- Preventative (Data encryption, application filtering, access control systems)
- Deterrant (signs, security cams, guards)
- Detective (cctv, motion sens, IDS/IPS, SIEM (Sec Inf & Evnt Mng))
- Corrective (data backup and restory procs, IRP and IR procedures)
- Compensating (network segmentation, virtualization)
- Recovery (DRP, data backup and restor utils, BCP)
- Directive (acceptable use policy (AUP), password policy, data classification policy)

EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF SECURITY:

- Security Triangle:
	* Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
	
- Confidentiality: Ensure sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals or systems
- Integrity: Ensure Data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered during storage, 
		transmission, and processing.
- Availability: Ensure auth users have timely and uninterrupted access to rescs. and systems.

- Security Triangle Support:

	* Non-repudiation: Integrity check control, accountability, prove origin and integ of data.
	* Authenticity: Confirm legit users, data sources, and comms helps ensure info is acc and trustworthy, 
		free form unauth alterations.
	* Accountability: Estab a traceable record of actions and actv. that make indiv responsible for 
		actions contrib. to the overall security and integ of data, sys, and comms.
	* Principle of Lease Privilege: Restrict user and sys permis. to min necess level reduces potential att. surfaces,
		and safeguards confidentiality, integrity and availability of resrcs.
	
- Ensure confidentiality:
	* encryption
	* access contr.
	* secure comms chans.
	
- Ensure integ:
	* hashing
	* digital signs.
	* integ checks

- Ensure Availability:
	* redundancy
	* load balancing
	* backups

EXAMINING AUTHENTIFICATION FACTORS:

- Authentification: Identity validation
- Auth Factor: distinct form of evidence or proof of identity

- username, pwd
- PIN
- smart card
- key fob
- auth application
- device thats registered or compliant
- biometrics
- DNA
- specific location
- trusted network
- pattern recognition or arrangement

- MFA: gain access to app with two or more auth steps (electronically)

EXAMINING AUTHORIZATION AND ACCESS CONTROL MODELS:

- Managing authorization, implement:
	* DAC: data owners determine and manage access permissions to their resources
	* Mandatory access control (MAC): A central authority determines access permissions based on
		predefined security labers or classifications.
Rol	* RBAC: A central authority determines access permissions based on predefined security labes or class..
Rul	* Rule-based access control: A set of explicitly defined rules or conditions determines access decis..

EXAMINING AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, AND ACCOUNTING (AAA):

- Accounting: process of tracking and recording user activ, resource usage within a sys, providing an
	audit trail of actions for accountability, compiance, and monitoring purposes.
	
** Typically AAA is brought together to enable remove access with RADIUS which is a networking protocol
	to centralize and manage user AAA for remote network access. (RFC 2865)
	
- RADIUS is typically used for:
	* Network access control (NAC): authenticate and authorize users who are accessing a network, such as 
		WIFI or a VPN to ensure only authorized individ. gain access.
	* Wireless networking: Help secure access to WIFI networks in etnerprises and public hotspots by
		verifying user credentials.
	* Remote access servers (RAS): control access to RAS such as dial-up and VPN servers.
	* ISPs: authenticate and authorize users conncting to ISP networks, thereby managing bandwid. and services.

** Ports used in RADIUS protocol are: 	- UDP Port 1645 or 1812 for authentication 
										- UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting.
	
EXAMINING PHYSICAL SECURITY:

- Bollards: provide barriers againsts vehicle-based attacks, thereby helping prevent access to sensitive areas.
- Access control vestibule: creates a controlled entry point, which mitigates the risk of unauthorized
	access to secure locations.
- Fencing
- Video surveillance
- Security guards
- Access badge
- Lighting
- Sensors: provide real-time detection and alerts for unauthorized movements, breaches, and environmental
	changes, which enables early threat identification and response. Sensor types include:
		* IR
		* Pressure
		* Microwave
		* Ultrasonic

EXAMING DECEPTION AND DISRUPTION TECHNOLOGY:

- Deception and disruption tech: tools and techniques used to recognize and then divert an attacker within network.

- Honeyfiles: a file or doc placed as bait in network to attract attackers. honeyfiles enable you to attract
	and detect unauth access or exfiltration attempts. you then can study this info to identify the techniques
	and potential intetions of bad actors without risking actual resources.
- Honeytokens: A piece of fake or delib weak data placed in sys or network to act as decoy. Honeytokens enable you
	to spot potential unauth activ or security breaches. study info to identify techniques and intents without risking
	actualy network assets.
- Honeypots: A deceptive sys or network designed to attract and trap potential attackers. honeypots enable you to monitor
	the activities of bad actors or threat actors, and you then can study this info to identify techniq. and potential.
	itentions without risking actualy network assets.
- Honeynets: a network of honeypots designed to simulate larger, more enticing targets that enables you to lure
	and study attackers. Honeynets allow you to monitor and study the activities of bad actors and threat actors without
	risking actualy network assets.

BUSINESS PROCESSES AND SECURITY OPERATIONS:

- Sometimes business processes might not align with, and can impact, its security operations.

- Stakeholders: have strong organization interest. 
	* Positive affect: helping ensure alignment of sec objectives and enabling sec awareness and compliance within org.
	* Neg affect: resisting implementation of sec measures, overlook vulner., decreasing sec awareness, and compromising
		overall security posture.
- Approval processes: 
	* Pos aff: enhanc. decision-making through consider. of diverse perspect., thereby increas. likelihood of well-inf. 
		and secure changes.
	* Neg aff: result in miscomm. and uncontr. changes, disruptions, errors, and security vulnerabilities.
- Ownership:
	* Pos aff: by clearly defining and assigning responsi. for asset's mngmt, maint., and sec throughout its lifecycle.
	* Neg aff: lack of ownership lead to diminished accountability, which makes challenging to ident. respons. parties
		if security incidents or breaches occur.
- Impact analysis:
	* Pos aff: enable you to assess potential consequences of proposed changes. Organi. then can use test results to 
		make strategic data-driven decisions and provide risk mitigation to ensure a successful systematic approach to
		implementing changes.
	* Neg aff: if changes are implem. w/o a comprehensive understanding of their potential conseq.. Results might be
		unanticipated disruptions, financial losses, decreased user satis. or confid., and impaired organi. performance.
- Standard operating procedure:
	* Pos aff: help ensure sec meas. and protocols are consist. integrated into the change process, thereby enhancing 
		an organizations ability to mitigate sec risks during transitions.
	* Neg aff: failure to integ sec into std operating proced. within change mngmt can result in increased sec vuln.,
		and dmg to organization's repution.
- Maintenance windows:
	* Pos aff: help ensure changes occur during scheduled, non-critical times; minimizing disrutpions; enhancing coord.;
		and improving overall operational efficiency.
	* Neg aff: unplan. service interr., confl., and oper. dirsuptions due to changes occurring at inopp. times.
- Backout plans:
	* Pos aff: prov. a safety net, allowing organi. to revert to a previous state if changes result in issues. This
		minimizes downtime and helps ensure business continuity.
	* Neg aff: intro prolonged downtime, data loss, service disruptions, and increased risk of issues during changes
		that you cant resolve rapidly.
