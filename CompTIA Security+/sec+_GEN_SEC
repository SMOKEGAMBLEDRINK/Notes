EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF SECURITY:

- Security Triangle:
	* Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
	
- Confidentiality: Ensure sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals or systems
- Integrity: Ensure Data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered during storage, 
		transmission, and processing.
- Availability: Ensure auth users have timely and uninterrupted access to rescs. and systems.

- Security Triangle Support:

	* Non-repudiation: Integrity check control, accountability, prove origin and integ of data.
	* Authenticity: Confirm legit users, data sources, and comms helps ensure info is acc and trustworthy, 
		free form unauth alterations.
	* Accountability: Estab a traceable record of actions and actv. that make indiv responsible for 
		actions contrib. to the overall security and integ of data, sys, and comms.
	* Principle of Lease Privilege: Restrict user and sys permis. to min necess level reduces potential att. surfaces,
		and safeguards confidentiality, integrity and availability of resrcs.
	
- Ensure confidentiality:
	* encryption
	* access contr.
	* secure comms chans.

	* Mandatory access control (MAC): A central authority determines access permissions based on
		predefined security labers or classifications.
Rol	* RBAC: A central authority determines access permissions based on predefined security labes or class..
Rul	* Rule-based access control: A set of explicitly defined rules or conditions determines access decis..

EXAMINING AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, AND ACCOUNTING (AAA):

- Accounting: process of tracking and recording user activ, resource usage within a sys, providing an
	audit trail of actions for accountability, compiance, and monitoring purposes.
	
** Typically AAA is brought together to enable remove access with RADIUS which is a networking protocol
	to centralize and manage user AAA for remote network access. (RFC 2865)
	
- RADIUS is typically used for:
	* Network access control (NAC): authenticate and authorize users who are accessing a network, such as 
		WIFI or a VPN to ensure only authorized individ. gain access.
	* Wireless networking: Help secure access to WIFI networks in etnerprises and public hotspots by
		verifying user credentials.
	* Remote access servers (RAS): control access to RAS such as dial-up and VPN servers.
	* ISPs: authenticate and authorize users conncting to ISP networks, thereby managing bandwid. and services.

** Ports used in RADIUS protocol are: 	- UDP Port 1645 or 1812 for authentication 
										- UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting.

CHANGE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTATION:

!! Identify and explain implciations of change management to security, given a scenario.

- Tech implication of change management on security:
	* Allow/deny lists

EXAMINING ENCRYPTION SOLUTIONS:

!! Identify and explain the importance of encryption, given a scenario.

- Encryption:
	* Block cipher: symmetric-key encryption algo. that encrypts data in fixed-size blocks by breaking it into chunks 
						by breaking it into chunks for processing.
	* Stream cipher: symetric-key encryption algo. that encrypts data bit-by-bit or byte-by-byte. It provides 	
						continuous encryption and decryption of data streams.

- Encryption levels:
	* Full-disk: Encrypts the entire contents of a disk.
	* Partition: Encrypts an isolated partition on a single disk.
	* File: Encrypts a file within an operation system.
	* Volume: Encrypts a logical disk. A volume can span multiple physical disks.
	* Database: Encrypts a database instance.
	* Record: Encrypts a set of data stored in a table thats within a database.

- Encryption types:
	* Asymmetric which is an encruption method that uses two mathematically aligned keys, known as a key pair 
		(public/private keys) for encryption and decryption.
	* Symmetric, which is an encryption method that uses a single key for encryption and decryption.

- Encryption keys:
	* shared or preshared key (incl. pwds): A cryptographic key thats used for encryp. and decryp.. Must be kepy
		confidential between authorized parties to maintain the sec of encrypt comms. or data.
	* Key exchange: sharing cryptograhic key process between parties to enable encrypt. comms..
	* Key length: size of crypto. key. Larger keys are potentially more secure than shorter key lengths. Longer keys 
		require more processing power.
	* Key stretching: strengthens resiliency of crypto key to brute force attacks. By applying hash function or block 
		cipher to the key repeatedly, you increase its length and complexity, makes more resistant to attacks such as
			brute force.
	* Salting: process of adding an extra piece of data to a password before its run through a hashing algorithm.

- PKI: 
	* A framework for securing comms through issuing and lifecycle management of digital keys and certs.
	* Implemented to facilitate encryption, authentication, digital signatures in online transactions and comms.

- PKI Components:
	* Certificate authority (CA):
		> Root/offline CA:
			>> The highest-level authority in the cert hierarchy, responsible for issuing and signing certs to
				subordinate CAs
			>> This CA's security is especially crucial and is commonly taken offline to prevent a compromise..
		> Subordinate/Issuing CA:
			>> Interm. authority that operates under root CA issuing and signing digital certs. Issue all certs lower
				than root CA in PKI hierarchy.
		> Standalone CA vs Enterprise CA:
			>> Standalone: independent CA that issues and manages certs, doesnt rely on a hierarchical structure, and
				is typically used in smaller or isolate environments.
			>> Enterprise: is integrated into an organizations network and issues and manages certs for internal use.
		> Internal CA vs External CA:
			>> Internal: CA used within organization's internal network to issue certs, with the authority not 
				trusted outside the organization.
			>> External: CA used for issuing certs to entities publically, with authority being trusted globally..
		> Root of trust: a trusted entity or authority whose digital signature and public key are accepted as a 
			foundation of trust in the PKI hierarchy 

	* Digital Certificate:
		> Electronic doc issued by trusted authority, or CA, that binds a public key to an indiv., device, or service.
		> Docs serve as a means of authentication and encryption for secure coms, dig. signatures, and access control.

	* Additional Components:
		> Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
			>> A formal request generated by an entity, such as an organization or user, to request digital cert from 
				a CA
			>> A CSR can be sent to an internal or external CA
		> Certificate Revocaiton List (CRL):
			>> Dynamically updated list maintained by CA containing serial nums of certs that have been revoked or
				are invalid before expiry
			>> Provides verificaiton and trustworthiness of the cert.
			>> This is an older resource-intensive method for determining if a cert is valid or revoked.
		> Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):
			>> real-time network protocol used to check validity and revocaiton status of certs
			>> provides verification and trustworthiness of the cert
			>> alternative method for determining if a cert is valid or revoked
		> Online Responder:
			>> a server that processes OCSP requests (certificate validity check requests)
			>> This provides quick, real-time responses on the validity and revocation status of certs.
			>> Less resource intesnive, greate efficiency
		> Key escrow
			>> Process of storing a copy of crypto keys with a trusted third-party
			>> commonly done for recovery or backup purposes to protect the keys from lost or compromise
